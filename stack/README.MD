# STACK

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming that follows the Last-In, `First-Out (LIFO)` principle. It is a collection of elements with two primary operations: push and pop. These operations are typically performed on the top of the stack.

LIFO : Last In First Out

## Method

- `lookup()` O(n)
- `pop()` O(1)
- `push()` O(1)
- `peek()` O(1)
