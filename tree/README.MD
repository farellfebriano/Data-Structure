# TREES

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is often implemented as an array, where the parent-child relationships are defined by the indices of the array elements. There are two main types of heaps: max-heap and min-heap.

## Two type of heap

- Min-Heap

## Most Common tree

- Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with the property that the value of each node's left child is less than or equal to the node's value, and the value of each node's right child is greater than or equal to the node's value.
- N-ary Tree: A tree in which each node can have more than two children.
- Trie: A tree-like data structure used for storing an associative array where the keys are usually strings.
- Heap: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which depends on whether it is a min-heap or a max-heap.
